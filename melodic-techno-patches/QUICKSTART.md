# Melodic Techno - Quick Start

## Launch

```bash
./run_looper.sh melodic-techno-patches
```

## The 3 Patches

**q = Patch A** - Hypnotic, minimal (opening/reset)  
**w = Patch B** - Evolving, arpeggiated (main groove)  
**e = Patch C** - Peak, intense (maximum energy)

## Essential Moves

### Starting a Set
1. Load Patch A (q)
2. Start with filter closed (only bass)
3. Gradually open filter over 2-3 loops
4. Melody reveals slowly = hypnotic entry

### Building Energy
1. Switch to Patch B (w)
2. Full filter open
3. Play with tom/clap layers (mute/unmute)
4. Ride for 3-5 minutes

### Peak Moment
1. Switch to Patch C (e)
2. Everything firing at full intensity
3. Wide filter sweeps
4. Stay for climax, then...

### Creating Contrast
1. Jump back to Patch A (q)
2. Close filter immediately
3. Dramatic drop = huge impact
4. Rebuild slowly

## Filter is Everything

**Low-Pass Filter** (most important!)
- Closed → Only bass
- Half → Bass + some melody
- Open → Full shine

**High-Pass Filter**
- Removes bass
- Floating ethereal lead
- Use before drops for tension

**Resonance**
- Adds character and movement
- Peak at filter cutoff
- Acid-like sound

## Quick Tips

✓ Stay on each patch 2-5 minutes minimum  
✓ Let it hypnotize before switching  
✓ Filter movement > patch changes  
✓ Silence creates tension  
✓ Trust the loop  

## Advanced Techniques

**Mute Games:**
- Drop bass suddenly → tension
- Return after 4-8 bars → release
- Drums only = build anticipation

**Effects:**
- Reverb on high lead (spacey)
- Delay 1/8 dotted (rhythmic)
- Distortion on bass (power)

**Sidechain:**
- Kick ducking bass = techno pump
- Classic groovy feel
- Essential for that "breathing" quality

## Remember

These patches are **tools, not tracks**.

**They provide:** Foundation, rhythm, melody  
**You create:** Dynamics, drama, journey

The magic is in your performance! 🎵
