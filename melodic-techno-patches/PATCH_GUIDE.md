# Melodic Techno Patch Guide

## Overview
3 seamlessly transitioning melodic techno patches designed for live performance manipulation.

**Core Specs:**
- **BPM**: 128 (locked)
- **Swing**: 0.0 (straight - pure techno)
- **Key**: A minor (dark, powerful)
- **Length**: 32 bars each (hypnotic loops)
- **Style**: Driving bass + ethereal high melodies

## Philosophy

These patches are **canvases for live manipulation**:
- No intro/outro needed - you create dynamics live
- No buildups/breakdowns - use filters, mutes, effects
- Seamless looping - stay on any patch as long as you want
- Seamless transitions - switch anytime without breaking the flow

## The 3 Patches

### **A - Hypnotic Foundation**
**Character**: Minimal, hypnotic, trance-inducing  
**Melody**: Simple A-C-D-C pattern in high octave  
**Bass**: Consistent A root with occasional C movement  
**Drums**: Clean 4/4 kick, sparse claps, minimal hats  

**Use For:**
- Opening your set
- Building tension slowly
- Filtered breakdowns
- Reset moments between peaks

**Live Manipulation:**
- Low-pass filter sweep to bring in melody gradually
- Mute bass for stripped moment, then drop it back
- Add reverb/delay to high lead for spacey feel

---

### **B - Evolving Sequences**
**Character**: Arpeggiated, evolving, more movement  
**Melody**: A-D-E-D-C-A-E-G sequence (more complex)  
**Bass**: A and C alternation with more rhythm  
**Drums**: Added tom fills and more clap accents  

**Use For:**
- Main groove section
- Peak energy moments
- Transitioning between A and C
- Maximum melodic interest

**Live Manipulation:**
- Push resonance on high-pass for acid-like lead
- Drop toms in/out for variation
- Use claps to build energy
- Modulate bass filter for movement

---

### **C - Peak Intensity**
**Character**: Dense, intense, full melodic interplay  
**Melody**: Complex A-D-G-E-D-C-G sequence, reaching very high (A @ MIDI 69)  
**Bass**: Driving A-C pattern with strong movement  
**Drums**: Maximum density - kick, claps, toms, open hats  

**Use For:**
- Peak moments
- Drop sections
- Maximum energy
- Climax of your set

**Live Manipulation:**
- All percussion active - drop layers selectively
- Wide filter sweeps work great here
- Distortion/overdrive on bass for extra power
- Open hi-hat creates lift - use sparingly for impact

## Musical Elements

### Key: A Minor
All patches use A minor pentatonic + extended notes:

**Bass Range (Low):**
- A (MIDI 33) - Root, driving force
- C (MIDI 36) - Minor third, movement
- D (MIDI 38) - Passing tone
- E (MIDI 40) - Fifth

**Lead Range (High - 2 octaves up):**
- A (MIDI 57, 69) - Melodic root
- C (MIDI 60) - Melody note
- D (MIDI 62) - Tension
- E (MIDI 64) - Resolution
- G (MIDI 67) - Seventh (dark color)

### Dual-Voice Bass Technique
Like the swing patches, one instrument plays TWO roles:
- **On-grid**: Bass foundation (A, C) on strong beats
- **Off-grid**: High melody filling gaps between bass notes
- **Result**: Rich, full sound from single synth voice

### Drums (Straight Techno - No Swing)
- **Kick (36)**: Every quarter note (classic 4/4)
- **Snare (38)**: Backbeat on 2 and 4
- **Closed Hi-hat (42)**: Constant 16th pattern (55-60 velocity)
- **Tom (47)**: Transitional fills (patches B & C)
- **Clap (50)**: Accent points and energy lifts
- **Open Hi-hat (46)**: Peak moments only (patch C)

## Live Performance Strategies

### Starting Your Set
```
A (hypnotic) → Filter sweep to bring in melody
             → Stay for 2-4 loops
             → Transition to B when ready
```

### Building Energy
```
B (evolving) → Full groove established
             → Play with tom/clap layers
             → Transition to C for peak
```

### Peak Moment
```
C (peak) → Maximum density and melody
         → Drop back to A or B to reset
         → Create contrast
```

### Creating Dynamics Without Changing Patches

**On Patch A (minimal):**
- Start: Bass only, filter closed
- Build: Gradually open filter to reveal high melody
- Peak: Everything open
- Drop: Close filter again, mute/unmute bass

**On Patch B (evolving):**
- Ride the filter resonance for movement
- Drop toms in/out for variation
- Mute bass briefly for tension, then drop it back

**On Patch C (dense):**
- Strip back drums to just kick + bass
- Build by adding claps, toms, hats progressively
- Full peak = everything firing
- Use open hi-hat sparingly for lift

## Transition Strategies

All patches resolve to the same notes, so transitions are seamless:

**A → B**: Smooth evolution, more movement  
**B → C**: Energy increase, denser texture  
**C → A**: Contrast drop, reset energy  
**C → B**: Slight pullback, maintain momentum  
**B → A**: Wind down, hypnotic return  
**A → C**: Bold jump to peak (risky but effective!)

### Safe Transition Points
- Any 4-bar boundary
- Best: 8, 16, or 32 bar boundaries
- All bass patterns resolve to root (A or C)

## Filter Technique

Since bass plays both low and high:

**Low-pass Filter:**
- Closed: Only bass audible
- Half: Bass + some melody
- Open: Full melody shine

**High-pass Filter:**
- Use to remove bass temporarily
- Leaves ethereal high melody floating
- Great for tension before drop

**Resonance:**
- Emphasize different octaves
- Creates acid-like movement
- Peak resonance at filter cutoff

## Effects Suggestions

**Reverb:**
- Light on bass (10-20%) for depth
- Heavy on high lead (40-60%) for space
- Short decay for techno tightness

**Delay:**
- 1/8 or 1/16 dotted on high lead
- Creates rhythmic complexity
- Use sparingly to avoid mud

**Distortion/Overdrive:**
- On bass channel for power
- Drive during peak moments (patch C)
- Pull back for dynamics

**Compression:**
- Sidechain kick to bass (classic techno pump)
- Adds groove and clarity
- Enhances the hypnotic feel

## Performance Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with patch A, everything filtered
2. **Build Gradually**: Slowly reveal elements over 2-3 loops
3. **Use Contrast**: Jump between patches for energy shifts
4. **Trust the Loop**: Each patch works for 5-10 minutes with manipulation
5. **Filter is King**: Most drama comes from filter movement
6. **Mute for Impact**: Silence creates as much tension as sound
7. **Commit**: Stay on a patch long enough for hypnotic effect

## Technical Notes

- **BPM**: 128 (standard melodic techno)
- **Swing**: 0.0 (straight - unlike electro swing)
- **Pattern**: 16 steps = 1 bar at 128 BPM
- **Total loop**: 32 bars = ~60 seconds per patch
- **Transitions**: Seamless at any bar boundary

## Live Setup Recommendations

**Minimal Setup:**
- T-8 + these patches
- Use T-8's built-in filter, effects, mute buttons

**Extended Setup:**
- External filter for more control
- Reverb/delay pedal for high lead
- Sidechain compressor for pump
- Mixer to blend with other tracks

## Remember

These patches are **tools, not finished tracks**. They provide:
- Strong melodic foundation
- Driving rhythm
- Room for your creativity

**You bring:**
- Filter sweeps
- Mutes and drops
- Effects manipulation
- Timing and feel
- Your unique performance style

The magic happens when you play them live! 🎵
